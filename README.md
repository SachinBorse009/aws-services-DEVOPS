  ![aws for devops](https://github.com/SachinBorse009/aws-services-DEVOPS/assets/111965224/9c648121-3929-4277-a841-63544c0fe4aa)

AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a cloud computing platform provided by Amazon that offers a wide range of services and tools to help organizations build, deploy, and manage their applications and infrastructure. For DevOps teams, AWS provides a scalable and flexible environment that enables automation, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), and efficient collaboration between development and operations teams.

With AWS, DevOps practitioners can leverage cloud-based resources to streamline their software development processes, accelerate time to market, and improve overall efficiency. AWS offers a comprehensive suite of services designed specifically for DevOps practices, empowering teams to automate infrastructure provisioning, manage configurations, monitor applications, and implement robust security measures.

## List of AWS Services for DevOps:

- **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):** Amazon EC2 provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. You can quickly launch virtual servers, known as instances, and scale capacity up or down as needed. EC2 offers a wide range of instance types optimized for various workloads. [Learn more about Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)

- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):** Amazon VPC allows you to provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources. You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including IP addresses, subnets, route tables, and network gateways. [Learn more about Amazon VPC](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/)

- **IAM (Identity and Access Management):** AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. IAM allows you to create and manage users, groups, roles, and permissions to control who can access what within your AWS environment. [Learn more about IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/)

- **CloudWatch:** Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that collects and tracks metrics, logs, and events from various AWS resources. It provides actionable insights to monitor applications, respond to system-wide performance changes, optimize resource utilization, and get a comprehensive view of your AWS environment. [Learn more about Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)

- **AWS Lambda:** AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows you to run your code without provisioning or managing servers. It automatically scales your applications in response to incoming requests, and you only pay for the compute time consumed by your code. Lambda supports a wide range of programming languages and integrates with other AWS services. [Learn more about AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)

- **AWS CodeBuild:** AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service. It compiles source code, runs tests, and produces software packages that are ready to deploy. CodeBuild integrates with other AWS services and third-party tools to automate your build process and accelerate software delivery. [Learn more about AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/)

- **AWS CodePipeline:** AWS CodePipeline is a fully managed continuous delivery service that orchestrates the release process. It allows you to model, visualize, and automate the steps required to release your software. CodePipeline integrates with CodeBuild as a build action, enabling you to trigger builds automatically on code changes and include them as part of your delivery pipeline. [Learn more about AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/)

- **AWS CodeDeploy:** AWS CodeDeploy is a deployment service that automates application deployments to various compute environments, including EC2 instances, Lambda functions, and ECS clusters. CodeDeploy works seamlessly with CodeBuild, allowing you to automate the deployment of your built artifacts to your target environment. [Learn more about AWS CodeDeploy](https://aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/)

- **AWS CodeCommit:** AWS CodeCommit is a fully managed source code control service that hosts secure and scalable Git repositories. It provides a private and secure environment to store and manage your source code. CodeCommit integrates with CodeBuild, allowing you to trigger builds directly from your CodeCommit repositories. [Learn more about AWS CodeCommit](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/)

- **AWS Config:** AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources continuously. It provides a detailed view of the configuration history and resource relationships, allowing you to track changes, troubleshoot, and maintain compliance with your desired configurations. [Learn more about AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/)

- **AWS Billing and Cost Management:** AWS Billing and Cost Management provides tools and services to monitor, analyze, and optimize your AWS costs. It allows you to visualize your usage, set up budgets and alerts, explore cost-saving opportunities, and generate detailed billing reports. Managing costs effectively helps optimize your AWS spending. [Learn more about AWS Billing and Cost Management](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/)

- **AWS KMS (Key Management Service):** AWS Key Management Service is a managed service that allows you to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data. It provides a secure and scalable solution for managing cryptographic keys and integrates with other AWS services to help protect your data at rest and in transit. [Learn more about AWS KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/)

- **AWS CloudTrail:** AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account. It records API activity and creates log files to provide visibility into actions taken by users, roles, and services in your AWS environment. CloudTrail helps you understand and respond to changes made to your resources. [Learn more about AWS CloudTrail](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/)

- **Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service):** Amazon EKS simplifies the process of deploying, managing, and scaling Kubernetes clusters on AWS. It provides a highly available and secure Kubernetes control plane and integrates with other AWS services. EKS enables you to run containerized applications using Kubernetes without the need to manage the underlying infrastructure. [Learn more about Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/)
